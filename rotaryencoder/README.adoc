= TinyGo driver for a rotary encoder

This driver uses a slightly modified code from https://github.com/bgould/tinygo-rotary-encoder

I added the encoder channel to read the movement from and the switch channel.

The code that reads the encoder's state uses Gray code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code).
That makes readings very reliable and eliminates the need for debouncing.

The original C/Arduino code was written by Oleg Mazurov (@felis) and explained here:
