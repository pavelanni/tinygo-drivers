= TinyGo drivers

This repository contains TinyGo drivers either written by me,
or the drivers from the original repo slightly modified for specific devices (e.g. `tm1637`).
Not to be confused with the _real_ TinyGo drivers https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers.

== TM1637

This driver was modified by changing the delay time to address an issue with a specific implementation.
Thanks to https://github.com/bxparks[@bxparks] for the solution. See more in the README.

== Rotary encoder

This rotary encoder driver is a slightly modified version of https://github.com/bgould/tinygo-rotary-encoder
I added the encoder channel to read the movement from and the switch channel.
